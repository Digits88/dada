### Fall 2017

### M/W/F 10:00-10:50, Rice 130

**Instructor:** Aaron Bloomfield (aaron@virginia.edu). Office is Rice
  Hall, room 403. Office hours are M/W 1:00-2:30 and other times by
  appointment

**Pre-requisites:** This course requires completion of CS 2150 with a
  grade of C- or above.

**Reading:** Due to the rapidly changing nature of this topic, there
  is no assigned textbook -- the best textbook on the topic is already
  5-10 years out of date. Readings will consist of handouts, online
  materials, and articles (both media and scholarly).  Much of the
  background for this course depends on completing the readings. Thus,
  occasional pop quizzes will happen to ensure that everybody is doing
  the reading (and to ensure that people are showing up to class!).

**Grading:** There will be one midterm (15% of the grade, on
  Wednesday, October 9th) and a final exam (25% of the grade, on
  Friday, December 15th at 9 a.m.). The homework assignments will
  constitute 50% of your grade. Attendance in class is
  noted. Participation will be the remaining 10%; participation will
  consist of in-class pop-quizzes, attendance, etc. Excessive
  unexcused absences from class is grounds for receiving a lower (or
  even failing!) grade. I reserve the right to adjust the percentages
  based on the number of assignments and quizzes, and other factors.

**Assignments:** There are expected to be one assignment every 1.5
  weeks, on average.  Some will be shorter and easier, some will be
  longer and harder.  There will be both programming assignments as
  well as occasional pencil and paper assignments.

**Course rules:** You are fully responsible for all material presented
  in class. Exams and due dates are scheduled in advance. A grade of
  zero will be recorded for missed exams and late assignments unless
  prior arrangements are made. Assignments turned in after the due
  date are penalized 25% per day (or fraction thereof) late; this
  means a maximum of 3 days (i.e. 72 hours) late. You are free to
  develop assignments on any platform/OS you wish. However, you are
  responsible for porting your code to the system the class is using
  and ensuring that it runs correctly for us when we grade your
  assignment. Our reference system will specified for each assignment,
  but will generally be Ubuntu Linux.  Some assignments will be graded
  by automated unit testing.

**Cheating:** Students are encouraged to discuss programs and
  assignments in general. However, helping others find bugs in
  existing programs, using another person's code, or writing code for
  someone else is cheating and a violation of the University’s Honor
  System. Basically, you should not be looking at another person's
  code for ANY reason (obviously you can after BOTH have submitted the
  assignment, or if there is a group project). This includes
  consulting solutions to assignments from previous years or tests
  from previous years. Any honor violation or cheating will be
  referred to the honor committee, and will result in an immediate
  failure for the course, regardless of the outcome of the honor trial
  or your other grades. No exceptions! I am very strict on this, and
  one have successfully raised honor charges against students in the
  past due to violations of this policy - and I've blocked people from
  graduation because of honor offenses.

**Course Objectives:**

- Understand the nature and types of viruses (and other malware), and
  how they are threats to computer systems.
- Learn the techniques used to prevent, detect, repair, and defend
  against viruses and worms.
- Learn to use program binary examination tools to detect malicious code.
- Understand the ethical issues surrounding computer security violations.

**Syllabus:** The following is the list of topics we expect to
  cover. The order we will cover them in depends largely on the
  homeworks – while we generally expect to cover the material in the
  order provided, the primary objective is to have the topic covered
  around the time the homework is assigned.

- Categories of threats, terminology, overview of Intel x86
  architecture
