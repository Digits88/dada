## Badness of the day: [Stoned virus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoned_(computer_virus))
- This was a 1987 DOS virus, and one of the first viruses
- It was multi-partite:
  - Infected the *master boot record*
  - Stayed resident in memory (used the upper 2Kb)
  - Hooked the disk interrupt
- Thus, the AV software had to remove all three, else the system would be re-infected
- It printed out "You've been stoned" every 8th boot
- When it infected the MBR, it wrote the orignal to the end of the disk
  - But it was designed for 360 Kb floppies, so it wrote it to sector 361 (sic)
  - Which was right in the middle of the data when floppies went to 1.2 Mb
  - Thus, it was *accidentally destructive*

## Badness of the day: Experian problems
- This is not Equifax, but another of the three credit agencies
- Remember when it was suggested to place credit freezes with the three credit agencies? Yeah, about that...
- It turns out that it is [very easy to remove one from Experian](https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/21/16345422/experian-credit-freeze-equifax-breach-vulnerable)
  - To reset one, you need: name, address, dob, and ssn
  - All info released by Equifax's security breach!
  - And a few questions that are likely Google-able
- Then they will do a "scan" of the "dark web" for you
  - But read their [17,600 word terms of service](http://www.latimes.com/business/lazarus/la-fi-lazarus-experian-dark-web-20170922-story.html)
  - You are giving "acceptance of 'advertisements or offers' from financial products companies"
  - And "an arbitration clause preventing you from suing the company"

## Badness of the day: [new Locky variant](https://blog.barracuda.com/2017/09/19/barracuda-advanced-technology-group-monitoring-aggressive-ransomware-threat/) ransomware
- Recall that the [Ranson.Lukitus](https://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2017-090111-1559-99) from a few weeks ago was another Locky variant
- Locky encrypts files with an identifier; given the identifier, and a paid ransom, those behind it will send along a decryptor
- But this only uses one identifier
  - So will one decryptor work for anybody?
  - Or, more likely, they are they not bothering to send along a decryptor
- Originating mostly from Vietnam, but other countries as well; likely not a nation-state, since the motives are financial
- The emails are either a Herbalife order receipt or a copier scan delivery
  - But the email (and possibly the payload) are mutating, preventing easy scanning for it
- 20 million attacks in a 24 hour period!

## Badness of the day: Python's official repository
- The Slovak National Security Office (NBU) identified 10 malicious Python apps
- They performed all the regular functions, plus had a (relatively benign) payload
- They all had similar names ('urlib' instead of 'urllib'), so a typo would install it
- There is no approval or security checks to put software in the PyPI (Python Package Index)
- The `pip` command does not do any checking, either
- The apps have been removed...

=================================================

## Equifax data breach, part 2
- Recall that the information on an estimated *143 million* people was compromised because they had a crappy excuse for enterprise security
- New developments:
  - The FTC is investigating (and they confirmed it, which is unusual ([source](https://yro.slashdot.org/story/17/09/14/1430235/in-a-highly-unusual-move-ftc-confirms-it-is-investigating-equifax))
  - Their login for Equifax in Argentina? username: admin, password: admin ([source](https://news.slashdot.org/story/17/09/13/1840258/equifax-had-admin-as-login-and-password-in-argentina))
  - They lobbied for easier regulartion before the data breach ([source](https://politics.slashdot.org/story/17/09/12/1339211/equifax-lobbied-for-easier-regulation-before-data-breach))
  - Their app has "disappeared" from Google Play and the iTunes store ([source](https://tech.slashdot.org/story/17/09/12/043246/equifaxs-app-has-disappeared-from-apples-app-store-and-google-play))
  - Chatbot Lets You Sue Equifax For Up To $25,000 Without a Lawyer ([source](https://yro.slashdot.org/story/17/09/12/074253/chatbot-lets-you-sue-equifax-for-up-to-25000-without-a-lawyer))
  - Equifax Blames Open-Source Software For Its Record-Breaking Security Breach ([source](https://news.slashdot.org/story/17/09/11/2048245/equifax-blames-open-source-software-for-its-record-breaking-security-breach))
- To find out if you are affected, see https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/6ysxxf/how_to_tell_if_you_got_equifaxd_and_what_to_do/
  - But beware -- if you click on the wrong equifax button, you are agreeing not to sue them (read the reddit page for details)
  - That reddit page also talks about how to lock your accounts with all three credit agencies
    - It costs $10 each in Virginia; the amount varies by state

## Badness of the day: [BlueBorne](https://www.armis.com/blueborne/)
- You know about Bluetooth?  Well, funny thing about that...
- Virtually *all* Bluetooth devices are vulnerable to being hacked
    - This means your phone!  And iPad, and IoT devices, and ...
    - This affects Bluetooth implementations in Android, iOS, Microsoft, and Linux
- From the link above: "BlueBorne is an attack vector by which hackers can leverage Bluetooth connections to penetrate and take complete control over targeted devices"
- It's a problem
    - It does not require downloading a file, clicking on a link, or being connected to the Internet
    - This works through errors in the pairing protocol
    - In theory, a worm could spread through this via people with unknowingly infected devices
- [YouTube video link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLNtZKpL0P8)
- So what to do?
    - If you have Android, install the "BlueBorne scanner" app
    - Turn off Bluetooth unelss you are actively using it, unless you know your machine is not vulnerable
        - Either because of that app, or because of a system update that fixes this issue
- More references: [here](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/blueborne-vulnerabilities-impact-over-5-billion-bluetooth-enabled-devices/) and [here](https://mobile.slashdot.org/story/17/09/12/2030213/blueborne-vulnerabilities-impact-over-5-billion-bluetooth-enabled-devices) and [here](http://go.armis.com/hubfs/BlueBorne%20Technical%20White%20Paper.pdf)

## Badness of the day: Equifax data breach
- The information on an estimated *143 million* people was compromised
  - Because they had a crappy excuse for enterprise security
- To find out if you are affected, see https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/6ysxxf/how_to_tell_if_you_got_equifaxd_and_what_to_do/
  - But beware -- if you click on the wrong equifax button, you are agreeing not to sue them (read the reddit page for details)
  - That reddit page also talks about how to lock your accounts with all three credit agencies
    - It costs $10 each in Virginia; the amount varies by state

## Badness of the day: [Ranson.Lukitus](https://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2017-090111-1559-99)
- "Ransom.Lukitus is a Trojan horse that encrypts files on the compromised computer and demands a payment to decrypt them."
- It has infected 23 *million* emails in 24 hours ([source](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/cybercrime-and-digital-threats/new-locky-variant-lukitus-distributed-in-23-million-emails))
- A variant of [Locky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locky); Locky does:
  - Sends a .doc as an attachment
  - Looks to be garbage when opened, so it asks the user to enable macros to encode properly
  - The macros download a binary which encrypts files on the computer
  - Then the computer demands a ransom to work
- Lukitus works similarly, but it's a .vbs script
  - And I received one yesterday!

- The modems used if you get your Internet through AT&T
  - About 4 million subscribers
- Their modems have a few ever-so-minor vulnerabilities:
  - An account with hardcoded username/password exposed to the internet via SSH
    - It's remotessh/5SaP9I26, in case you were wondering
  - A HTTP server with little authentication which allows command injection
  - An internet exposed service which exposes internal clients to external attacks
  - And the list goes on!
- The modem has a "kernel module whose sole purpose seems to be to inject advertisements into the user's unencrypted web traffic"
  - Although no evidence exists that said module was ever put into use

## Badness of the day: [Packemaker vulnerabilities](http://www.zdnet.com/article/fda-forces-st-jude-pacemaker-recall-to-patch-security-vulnerabilities/)
- Pacemakers are being more intelligent
  - Much of their operation is software based
  - They can wirelessly connect to diagnostic devices and what-not
- All of this is programmed via firmware, which has found to be vulnerable to attack
- The vulnerabilities could allow attackers to "drain pacemaker battery life, allow attackers to change programmed settings, or even change the beats and rhythm of the device"
  - [FDA communication](https://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/Safety/AlertsandNotices/ucm573669.htm)
- The FDA extimates 465,000 pacemakers are affected, and patients should seek a firmware update
  - The catch?  An update could cause the device to fail!
  - (Althought that is estimated to be very rare)
- Note that no exploit has been revealed (at least to the public)
- This has implications for other "smart" machines: cars, planes, etc.

## Badness of the day: WireX
- WireX is (was?) a botnet of "tens of thousands" of Android devices
  - This is a new class of attack -- one of the first known Android DOS attacks -- which will require different strategies to defeat
  - [Some](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/08/first-known-android-ddos-malware-infects-phones-in-100-countries/) claim 120,000 infected devices; there were 70,000 concurrent on 8/26
- Installed via 300 (!) "mobile apps scattered across Google's Play store that were mimicking seemingly innocuous programs, including video players, ringtones or simple tools such as file managers"
  - [Google pulled 500 backdoored apps](https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/2017/08/23/google-pulls-500-backdoored-apps-google-play/) on August 23rd, but there were already 100 million downloads of them
  - As the apps are removed from the Google play store, Google is slowly getting them removed from end user devices
- There was an [unusual collaboration by 6 competiting tech companies](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/08/tech-firms-team-up-to-take-down-wirex-android-ddos-botnet/) about this issue, indicating the severity

- A good summary article is [here](https://www.incapsula.com/blog/hidden-cobra-deltacharlie-explained.html)
- This malware uses "capabilities such as DDoS botnets, keyloggers, remote access tools (RATs), and wiper malware"
- Hidden Cobra "has been previously reported as the Lazarus Group and Guardians of Peace"
  - They are known for their 2014 Sony Pictures hack
  - Presumably in retaliation for the movie entitled [The Interview](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Interview)
