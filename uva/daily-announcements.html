## Badness of the day: [AT&T Uverse modems](https://threatpost.com/bugs-in-arris-modems-distributed-by-att-vulnerable-to-trivial-attacks/127753/)
- The modems used if you get your Internet through AT&T
  - About 4 million subscribers
- Their modems have a few ever-so-minor vulnerabilities:
  - An account with hardcoded username/password exposed to the internet via SSH
    - It's remotessh/5SaP9I26, in case you were wondering
  - A HTTP server with little authentication which allows command injection
  - An internet exposed service which exposes internal clients to external attacks
  - And the list goes on!
- The modem has a "kernel module whose sole purpose seems to be to inject advertisements into the user's unencrypted web traffic"
  - Although no evidence exists that said module was ever put into use

## Badness of the day: [Packemaker vulnerabilities](http://www.zdnet.com/article/fda-forces-st-jude-pacemaker-recall-to-patch-security-vulnerabilities/)
- Pacemakers are being more intelligent
  - Much of their operation is software based
  - They can wirelessly connect to diagnostic devices and what-not
- All of this is programmed via firmware, which has found to be vulnerable to attack
- The vulnerabilities could allow attackers to "drain pacemaker battery life, allow attackers to change programmed settings, or even change the beats and rhythm of the device"
  - [FDA communication](https://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/Safety/AlertsandNotices/ucm573669.htm)
- The FDA extimates 465,000 pacemakers are affected, and patients should seek a firmware update
  - The catch?  An update could cause the device to fail!
  - (Althought that is estimated to be very rare)
- Note that no exploit has been revealed (at least to the public)
- This has implications for other "smart" machines: cars, planes, etc.

## Badness of the day: WireX
- WireX is (was?) a botnet of "tens of thousands" of Android devices
  - This is a new class of attack -- one of the first known Android DOS attacks -- which will require different strategies to defeat
  - [Some](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/08/first-known-android-ddos-malware-infects-phones-in-100-countries/) claim 120,000 infected devices; there were 70,000 concurrent on 8/26
- Installed via 300 (!) "mobile apps scattered across Google's Play store that were mimicking seemingly innocuous programs, including video players, ringtones or simple tools such as file managers"
  - [Google pulled 500 backdoored apps](https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/2017/08/23/google-pulls-500-backdoored-apps-google-play/) on August 23rd, but there were already 100 million downloads of them
  - As the apps are removed from the Google play store, Google is slowly getting them removed from end user devices
- There was an [unusual collaboration by 6 competiting tech companies](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/08/tech-firms-team-up-to-take-down-wirex-android-ddos-botnet/) about this issue, indicating the severity
- A good summary is [here](http://www.techrepublic.com/article/how-a-consortium-of-security-professionals-took-down-the-wirex-android-botnet/)

## Badness of the day: Hidden Cobra
- Hidden Cobra is the DOS framework used by North Korea (DPRK)
- There is a recent [US CERT advisory](https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/alerts/TA17-164A) as well as a [US CERT web page](https://www.us-cert.gov/HIDDEN-COBRA-North-Korean-Malicious-Cyber-Activity) on it
- Formally:
  - Hidden Cobra is the malicious activity by DPRK
  - DeltaCharlie is the malware used in this (and other) instances
    - DeltaCharlie was originally uncovered by a [2016 report](https://www.operationblockbuster.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Operation-Blockbuster-Destructive-Malware-Report.pdf) (page 41 therein)
- A good summary article is [here](https://www.incapsula.com/blog/hidden-cobra-deltacharlie-explained.html)
- This malware uses "capabilities such as DDoS botnets, keyloggers, remote access tools (RATs), and wiper malware"
- Hidden Cobra "has been previously reported as the Lazarus Group and Guardians of Peace"
  - They are known for their 2014 Sony Pictures hack
  - Presumably in retaliation for the movie entitled [The Interview](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Interview)

## Badness of the day: Sonos
- [Sonos](http://sonos.com) sells smart speakers and sound systems that range from $100 to $1000
- They are now requiring that customers accept their new privacy policy or they may end up with "sound systems that may eventually cease to function"
  - So if you just spent a lot of money on a sound system, either you agree to give any and all private information to Sonos or else you just lost a lot of money on a bricked sound system
- Source: original from [zdnet](http://www.zdnet.com/article/sonos-accept-new-privacy-policy-speakers-cease-to-function/) and posted to [slashdot](https://yro.slashdot.org/story/17/08/22/1549226/sonos-says-users-must-accept-new-privacy-policy-or-devices-may-cease-to-function)
