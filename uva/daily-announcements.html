## Monday, August 28
- My office hours start this week, and are M/W 1:00-2:30
  - I put the wrong time in the [course introduction](../slides/01-intro.html#/), which has since been corrected
  - TA office hours will start soon as well
- First two homeworks have been released
  - [HW 1: Virtual Machines](../hws/hw1-vm.html) is due this Friday (September 1st)
  - [HW 2: x64 assembly](../hws/hw2-x64.html) is due next Friday (September 8th)
  - All homeworks are due by midnight on the date specified
  - Submission details will be made available early this week
- The VirtualBox image is avilable to download: http://tinyurl.com/y83lv7sd
  - That is an updated version (and link); if you downloaded it before 9:45 a.m. Friday (8/25), then run the following command (needed for HW 2):
  - `sudo apt-get install g++-multilib libc6-dev-i386 libc6-dev:i386 flex`
  - Note that the new file name will end in ".vdi-v2.zip"
  - Directions for installation are in [HW 1: Virtual Machines](../hws/hw1-vm.html)
- Today we will work finish [terminology](../slides/02-terminology.html#/) (starting [here](../slides/02-terminology.html#/howxported)) and start on [virtual machines](../slides/03-vms.html#/)

## Badness of the day
- Hidden Cobra is the DOS framework used by North Korea (DPRK)
- There is a recent [US CERT advisory](https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/alerts/TA17-164A) as well as a [US CERT web page](https://www.us-cert.gov/HIDDEN-COBRA-North-Korean-Malicious-Cyber-Activity) on it
- Formally:
  - Hidden Cobra is the malicious activity by DPRK
  - DeltaCharlie is the malware used in this (and other) instances
    - DeltaCharlie was originally uncovered by a [2016 report](https://www.operationblockbuster.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Operation-Blockbuster-Destructive-Malware-Report.pdf) (page 41 therein)
- A good summary article is [here](https://www.incapsula.com/blog/hidden-cobra-deltacharlie-explained.html)
- This malware uses "capabilities such as DDoS botnets, keyloggers, remote access tools (RATs), and wiper malware"
- Hidden Cobra "has been previously reported as the Lazarus Group and Guardians of Peace"
  - They are known for their 2014 Sony Pictures hack
  - Presumably in retaliation for the movie entitled [The Interview](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Interview)

## Badness of the day
- [Sonos](http://sonos.com) sells smart speakers and sound systems that range from $100 to $1000
- They are now requiring that customers accept their new privacy policy or they may end up with "sound systems that may eventually cease to function"
  - So if you just spent a lot of money on a sound system, either you agree to give any and all private information to Sonos or else you just lost a lot of money on a bricked sound system
- Source: original from [zdnet](http://www.zdnet.com/article/sonos-accept-new-privacy-policy-speakers-cease-to-function/) and posted to [slashdot](https://yro.slashdot.org/story/17/08/22/1549226/sonos-says-users-must-accept-new-privacy-policy-or-devices-may-cease-to-function)
