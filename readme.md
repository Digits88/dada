Defense Against the Dark Arts
=============================

This repository is for the Defense Against the Dark Arts (CS 4630)
course at the University of Virginia.  It is a computer science
elective taken in the 3rd or 4th year.

The course was originally created by
[Jack Davidson](http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~jwd/) in 2006 (see a
[SIGCSE publication on the course](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1352245)).
The material in this repository was taken, with permission, from the
slides created by Davidson and extended by
[Charles Reiss](https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~cr4bd/) and myself,
[Aaron Bloomfield](https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~asb/).
