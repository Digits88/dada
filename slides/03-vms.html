# History
	</script></section>

	<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Hardware utilization
- During the 1960s and 1970s
- IBM [VM/370 operating system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VM_(operating_system)
  - Hypervisor (control program) creates virtual machine environment
    - Each user has own virtual machine with guest OS, own address space, virtual devices, etc.
	</script></section>

	<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Decline
- In the 1980s and 1990s, VMs decline in popularity
  - Poor performance
  - Client-server applications
  - Inexpensive PCs
  - Distributed computing
- VMs started as mainframes (one computer for the entire company)
  - Then cheap PCs showed up
	</script></section>

	<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Renewed Interest
- In the late 1990s
-  WWW
  - Servers
  - Cross-platform support
  - Extending desktop computing environments
  - Security
- Issues/Challenges
  - Low Infrastructure Utilization
  - Physical infrastructure costs
  - IT management costs
  - Failover/disaster protection
  - High maintenance end-user desktops
	</script></section>

	<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Renewed Interest cont'd
- Virtual machines
  - Software compatibility
  - Isolation capability
  - Encapsulation
  - Low overhead/high performance

# Concepts
	</script></section>

	<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Virtual machine types
- Language level
  - Example: Java Virtual Machine
- Process level
  - Example: Wine
- Operating System level
  - Example: Docker, BSD jails
- System level
  - Example: VirtualBox, VMware, Hyper-V
	</script></section>

	<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Terminology
- Host OS: the operating system that booted the computer
- Guest *thing*: what is being run in the virtual machine
  - Here, *thing* could be a process, operating system, etc.
	</script></section>

	<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Language virtual machine
- The Java Virtual Machine is a classic example
  - Compiler translates .java files to bytecode (.class) files
- Any interpreter is really a language virtual machine
  - Python, Ruby, PHP, etc.
- The interpreter / langauge VM can:
  - Handle memory issues (including garbage collection)
  - Do lots of error checking and tracing
  - Still be reasonably fast
	</script></section>

## JVM diagram
![jvm](https://qph.ec.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-3d375760a6564a7b34c5936dfd66a814)
From [here](https://www.quora.com/What-is-difference-between-JDK-JRE-and-JVM)
	</script></section>

	<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Process virtual machine
- Allows one to run a single process
- Meant to provied a platform independent environment for a process to run
  - Abstracting away things like the hardware, host OS, etc.
- Wine (Windows emulator for Linux) is an example
  - The binary executes, but Windows system calls are translated into Linux system calls
  - A library (Winelib) fills in for Windows system calls that do not have Linux equivalents
	</script></section>

	<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Process VM examples
- Multiprogramming
  - Each user process given the illusion of having complete machine to itself
    - OS supporting multiple user processes
- Emulators and dynamic binary translators
  - Emulate one instruction set on hardware designed for different instruction set
  - Dynamic binary translation: convert blocks of source instructions to target instructions that perform equivalent functions
	</script></section>
	
	<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Process VM Examples (cont'd)
- Same-ISA binary optimizers
  - Optimization
    - Dynamo (HP 2000)
- High-level language VMs
  - Cross-platform portability
  - Minimize hardware-specific and OS-specific features
    - Java VM
- So one can argue that a language VM is really a process VM...
  - But we'll differentiate them
	</script></section>
	
	<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## OS virtual machine
- The host OS shares the same kernel with all the guest OSes
- But each guest OS has it's own memory space
  - This separates the different guest OSes from each other and the host OS
- First implementation was FreeBSD jails; Linux's first implementation was LXC
- Most common known example now is Docker
	</script></section>
	
	<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## OS virtual machine
- FreeBSD jails are a first-class concept in an OS
  - Meaning something the OS directly supports and implements
- Containers are not
  - They are built from other first-class concepts (namespaces, cgroups, etc.)
  - That means you can do more, but there are more bugs and complexity
- See [jfrazelle's blog post](https://blog.jessfraz.com/post/containers-zones-jails-vms/) for more
	</script></section>

	<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## System virtual machine
- Designed to emulate "real" hardwre
- Presents hardware, not drivers, to the guest
  - Whereas the other VMs will present network connections to the guest, a system VM will present an Ethernet device
  - Likewise, not memory allocation calls, but page tables
- These run entire operating systems, and take the most resources
- VirtualBox is the example we all know and love
  - Hyper-V is for Windows
	</script></section>

	<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## System VM examples
- Classic system
  - Virtual machine monitor (VMM) on bare hardware
    - IBM VM/370
- Hosted VM
  - Virtualizing software built on top of existing host operating system
    - VMWare, VirtualBox
	</script></section>
	
	<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## System VM examples (cont'd)
- Whole System VMs (Emulation)
  - Complete software system (OS and applications) supported on a host system running a different ISA and OS
    - VirtualPC (Windows on Mac)
- Codesigned VMs (Hardware optimization)
  - No native applications. VM software is part of hardware implementation
    - Transmeta Crusoe
	</script></section>

	<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Terminology confusion
- Some will eliminate OS level, since that's just process level on steroids
- Others will combine language level and process level, since they are both for a single process
  - [Wikipedia VM article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine) does this
	</script></section>

	<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Virtualization
- Formally:
  - Virtualization involves the construction of an isomorphism that maps a virtual guest system to a real host. ([Popek and Goldberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popek_and_Goldberg_virtualization_requirements), 1974)
	</script></section>
	
	<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Virtualization
- Mapping of virtual resources or state to real resources on underlying machine
  - E.g., registers, memory, files
- Emulation of the virtual machine ABI or ISA
  - Use of real machine instructions and/or system calls to carry out actions specified by virtual machine instructions and/or system calls

# VM Operations
	</script></section>
	
	<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## OS refresher
- User programs run in *user mode*
  - Where a crash (segfault) will kill the process, but not the entire OS
  - Programs are restricted in what they can do
    - They can't directly access hardware; they have to go through the OS
- The OS itself runs in *kernel mode*
  - Where a crash will, in fact, crash the entire OS
	</script></section>
	
	<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## User mode vs Kernel mode
- Boundary is defined by:
  - System calls
    - Called by user-mode programs, but the function body is completed in kernel mode
  - Device drivers
    - Code written by somebody other than the OS writer, but runs in kernel mode
    - (whether they are in kernel mode fully or not varies by OS)
	</script></section>
	
	<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## User mode vs Kernel mode
- If a guest OS tries a priviledged operation:
  - The VM forwards to the VMM
  - The VMM handles it by a system call if possible
    - But it's in kernel mode, so it can do it directly
	</script></section>
	
	<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## VMs and kernel mode
- VMs tend to run the guest OS in user mode
  - But the OSs think they are running on hardware, so they will attempt to do "priviledged" things (like access hardware directly)
- The Virtual Machine Monitor (VMM) handles this
  - It is tyipcally a device driver running in kernel mode
- Exceptions from the OS are passed, through the VMM, back to the VM

## Levels of Abstraction
- Allow implementation details at lower levels of a design to be ignored or simplified
- Arranged in a hierarchy

    - Logical components
	</script></section>
	
	<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Levels of Abstraction: HW/SW Interface
- High level language (HLL) -> Assembly language

  - Assembler (translation/mapping to ISA)
- Operating System -> Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)
  - Partial Interpretation (device drivers, etc)
- Instruction Set Architecture -> Digital logic
  - Hardware
- Digital logic -> Electronics (transistors, etc.)
  - Hardware
