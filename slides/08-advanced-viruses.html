## Anti-anti-virus Techniques
- Virus writers have devised numerous methods of resisting anti-virus software and making life difficult for anti-virus researchers
- A common stealth technique was *interrupt tunneling*, hence the name tunneling viruses
- Armored viruses make it difficut to analyze what they do
- Retroviruses attack the "immune system" (anti-virus software) on a host computer


## Armored Viruses
- Armored virus techniques fall naturally into five categories, corresponding to the five tools they are designed to combat:
    - Anti-disassembly
    - Anti-debugging
    - Anti-emulation
    - Anti-heuristics
    - Anti-goat

# Tunneling Viruses
	  </textarea></section>
	  
	  <section data-markdown data-separator="^\n$"><textarea data-template>
## DOS and disk access
- The BIOS that comes with each computer provides basic disk read/write routines ("handlers")
    - Most OSes today provide their own handlers
- The BIOS provides other handlers as well
- But DOS, being rather basic, didn't provide its own handlers -- it used the BIOS handlers
- To keep track of them, it used an *Interrupt Vector Table* (IVT)


## DOS IVT
![DOS IVT](images/08-advanced-viruses/dos-ivt.png)


## DOS' IVT
- The IVT was a array of pointers to the machine code (in memory) for the routine that would handle that event
- Interrupts are used for:
  - Disk access
  - Keyboard input
  - Errors (divide by zero, etc.)
  - And more!


## DOS' IVT
- Many valid programs want to put their own handler in:
    - Anti-virus for the disk handler: scan the files before reading / writing
    - Compression: compress on disk write, decompress on disk read
    - Encryption: like compression

![hooked interrupt](images/08-advanced-viruses/hooked-interrupt-valid.png)


## Installing ("hooking") your own handler
- Load the machine code into memory, get pointer thereto, and load that into a register
    - This example uses the `edx` register
- Get the address of the particular entry into the IVT for the handler you want to hook
    - The disk handler's entry happened to always be at address 0x4c (hence "4Ch" from [HW 4](../hws/hw4-lex.html))
- Call the following assembly code:
```
mov eax, 4Ch 
mov dword ptr [eax], edx 
```


## Tunneling Viruses
- Recall the DOS IVT (interrupt vector table) and the technique of interrupt hooking:
![hooked interrupt](images/08-advanced-viruses/hooked-interrupt-virus.png)
- The virus handler uses the BIOS handler for most tasks.


## Anti-virus Interrupt Monitors
- When an anti-virus program executes at boot-up time, it installs a monitor that lengthens the call chain even more:
![hooked interrupt](images/08-advanced-viruses/hooked-interrupt-chain.png)
-  The AV monitor checks to see if it is first on the call chain
    - If so, it calls the saved address for the next item on the chain (in this case, the compression handler)


## Detecting the Interrupt Hooking Virus
- However, if a virus has hooked the interrupt, then the anti-virus monitor code detects that it is not being called directly from the IVT:
![hooked interrupt](images/08-advanced-viruses/hooked-interrupt-virus-chain.png)
-  The AV monitor now begins virus disinfection.


## Tunneling Viruses
- A tunneling virus defeats the anti-virus monitor by following the interrupt call chain until it finds the end, installing itself there instead of at the beginning:
![hooked interrupt](images/08-advanced-viruses/hooked-interrupt-virus-tunneled.png)
-  The AV monitor now finds itself pointed to directly from the IVT and finds nothing to disinfect.


## Tunneling Methods
- The process of following the interrupt call chain is called tunneling, because the virus is trying to locate itself in the system in a place that is beneath the vision of the anti-virus software
- How can a virus follow the call chain?
    - Emulation (sophisticated and costly)
    - Stepping through instructions in debug mode
    - In DOS, scanning all of memory to find the code that calls the BIOS handler, which must be the end of the chain


## Tunneling Methods
- How can a virus follow the call chain?
    - Emulation (sophisticated and costly)
        - This method was published in a magazine, but we don't know of any such viruses
    - Stepping through instructions in debug mode
        - Hook INT 1, put it in trace mode
        - Yankee_Doodle did this
    - Scanning all of DOS memory
        - Most common way


## Defeating Tunneling Viruses
- The AV monitor can scan in both directions and records the call chain for later checking
- The AV monitor can scan for virus code patterns throughout all the handlers in the call chain, in case the virus had already tunneled down the chain before the AV software was installed
- The AV monitor removes the virus handler when it is detected


## Interrupt Wars
- An interrupt hooking virus usually has a memory-resident file infector component in addition to the interrupt handler; the handler calls the infector
- The memory-resident component can detect that the handler has been removed, and can re-install it at the end of the call chain


## Interrupt Wars
- The AV monitor will detect the new virus handler and remove it again; this interrupt war, carried on while interrupts are being processed, can make a system unstable
- Solution: find and remove the memory-resident code immediately before removing the handler

# Anti-disassembly techniques
	  </textarea></section>
	  
	  <section data-markdown data-separator="^\n$"><textarea data-template>
## Anti-Disassembly
- The broadest category of techniques that make disassembly difficult are the virus code encryption techniques
    - We've seen some of, and will study more soon
- Other techniques:
    -  Encrypted data
    -  Code obfuscation
    -  Using checksums
    -  Compressed code
- We will examine each of these briefly


## Encrypted Data
- The virus encrypts its data and decrypts it as it is used
- The encryption and decryption code is clearly visible, so it is straightforward to figure out
- BUT, when viewing the code in a disassembler, the data is garbled
- The anti-virus software engineer is slowed down by the need to emulate code, write a decryption utility program and paste data into it, etc.


## Encrypted Data Example
- The Fix2001 worm attacked Windows 95 systems in 2001
- The worm sent stolen accounts and passwords by email back to a free email address (e.g. hotmail.com) obtained with a false identity
- The worm author did not want the email address to be readable to a disassembler
- The address was in a constant data section that was encrypted
- Stepping through a debugger to watch the data be decrypted slows down the analysis


## Code Obfuscation
- Some obfuscation merely injects no-ops, do-nothings (e.g. `add eax, 0`)
    - Regular expression matching can filter these out
    - Analysis is not slowed much by these instructions
- You could also do a jump into the middle of a previous instruction
- It is slower to analyze code with roundabout computations, computed jump addresses rather than direct jumps, etc.


## Obfuscated Computation
- Example from Szor text, p. 223 (section 6.2.3):
- Straightforward code to write 256 bytes into a file:
```
mov  cx, 100h   ; 100h = 256 bytes to write
mov  ah, 40h    ; 40h = DOS function number
int  21h        ; Invoke DOS handler
```
- Convoluted code to do the same thing:
```
mov  cx, 003Fh  ; cx = 003fh
inc  cx         ; cx = 0040h
xchg ch, cl     ; swap ch, cl (cx = 4000h)
xchg ax, cx     ; swap ax, cx (ax = 4000h)
mov  cx, 0100h  ; cx = 100h
int  21h        ; Invoke DOS handler 
```


## Anti-Disassembly Checksums
- Consider (pseudo-)code that looks for a specific function name in the DLL export table:
```
for (each prototype in DLL export table) 
  if (0 == strcmp(name,"GetFileHandle(int)"))
      infect(current export table address);
endfor
```
- This is quite easy to read in the disassembled code
    - A good disassembler can even search and find the string "GetFileHandle" if the anti-virus researcher already suspects that is the function being infected


## Checksums cont'd.
- Instead, the virus could compute a checksum over the ASCII bytes of the two strings, store one as a constant, and compare the checksums for equality:
```
int ConstantName = 0x89f7e5b2; // Computed by virus writer
for (each prototype in DLL export table)
   int foo = checksum(name); 
   if (foo == ConstantName)
      infect(current export table address);
endfor
```
- This code no longer reveals the API name to a reader
- Anti-virus researcher must now step through the checksum computation to figure out what is going on
- Similar idea to encrypting data


## Anti-Disassembly Compression
- A virus can be stored using a compression algorithm, and decompressed during execution by a decompression code at the beginning of the virus
- As with encrypted data, the compression algorithm is exposed, but examination of disassembled code is greatly slowed down
- Anti-virus researcher might need to emulate the code, or step through it in a debugger

# Anti-debugging techniques
	  </textarea></section>
	  
	  <section data-markdown data-separator="^\n$"><textarea data-template>
## Anti-Debugging
- We have seen that anti-disassembly techniques might drive an anti-virus researcher to step through virus code in a debugger
- The next step in the escalating war between the virus and anti-virus communities is the development of virus code that resists being executed in a debugger


## Anti-Debugging Techniques
- Interrupts 1 and 3 are used often in x86 debugging
    - `INT 1` places the CPU in single-step mode
    - `INT 3` is inserted into the code by the debugger to set a breakpoint
- So we can hook these two interrupts...


## Anti-Debugging Techniques
- First anti-debugging technique: Hook these two interrupts
    - Anti-virus code must be used to unhook the interrupts  before debugging can proceed
    - Have interrupts 1 or 3 be re-assigned to an `IRET` rather than the debugger
    - Or have them decrypt the virus, so it can't be run in debugging mode
- Next anti-debugging technique: use a checksum to defeat `INT 3` breakpoints


## Anti-Debugging Techniques
- When you set a breakpoint in a debugger, it modifies the machine code in memory
    - Immediately after the instruction you want to break after, it adds an interrupt: `INT 3`
    - It also inserts itself as the interrupt handler for that interrupt
- Once the breakpoint is reached, it restores the machine code it overwrote


## Anti-Debugging Techniques
- If the virus code:
    - computes a checksum over a critical range of its code
    - stores that checksum in a constant
    - then recomputes the checksum as it runs
- Then it can detect the change when the `INT 3` instruction is injected into that code range, and just abort
- The virus now runs successfully without a debugger, but aborts when breakpoints are inserted
- Note that a code emulator is not defeated by this


## Anti-Debugging Techniques
- Next technique: Detecting changes in the state of the stack during single-step mode
- A single-step debugger places a state record on the stack, and updates it after each step, to record the current `IP` (instruction pointer) value and the contents of the `FLAGS` register
- The virus code can examine the stack and see changing values where they would not change during normal (non-debugger) execution, and abort


## Detecting Stack Changes
<!-- .slide: class="right-float-img-800" -->
![stack diagram](images/08-advanced-viruses/stack-diagram.png)
In single-step debug mode, the debugger, after each instruction, saves state change information in a record that is placed just beyond the top of the stack.

This location will be trampled by any user program instructions that change the stack, but the old info is not needed after an instruction is executed.


## Detecting Stack Changes
<!-- .slide: class="right-float-img-800" -->
![stack diagram](images/08-advanced-viruses/stack-diagram.png)
There is a hidden stack update instruction, performed by the debugger, that logically falls in between each pair of instructions shown.  This tramples on the spot that is just beyond the stack top.


## Detecting Stack Changes
- Without single-step debug state changes, a location on the stack will remain unchanged until an instruction changes it, but will be changed by the debugger after every instruction during single-step debug
- To detect this (16-bit code):
```
mov bp,sp              ; bp gets current stack pointer
push ax
pop ax                 ; old pushed value still at [bp-2]
                         ;  which is beyond current stack
cmp word ptr [bp-2],ax ; equal if no debugger
jne DEBUG              ; debugger detected! Go abort!
```


## Anti-Debugging Techniques
- If the virus encrypts part of its code, it can use the stack pointer in the decryption routine
    - When the debugger uses the stack to save state, it will change the stack pointer and cause the decryption to fail
    - Virus now executes only without a debugger
- Disabling the keyboard interrupt during virus execution prevents the AV researcher from using a debugger


## Detecting Debuggers
- On Win32 operating systems, an API is available: `IsDebuggerPresent()`
    - Virus can just abort if TRUE
- Many debuggers set registry keys when they are active
- Viruses can scan memory for debugger code


## Anti-Debugging Techniques
- Other techniques are listed in Szor, 6.2.7
    - Using `INT 3` to enter kernel mode in Win95
    - Using `INT 0` to generate a divide-by-zero exception
    - Using `INT 3` to generate an exception
    - ... and 10 (ten!) more
        - We've seen 12 in this lecture set, plus that 10 is 22 different methods to defeat a debugger
    - However, these methods do not work for code *emulators*

# Anti-emulation techniques
	  </textarea></section>
	  
	  <section data-markdown data-separator="^\n$"><textarea data-template>
## Anti-Emulation Techniques
- If armored viruses have driven AV researchers away from disassemblers and debuggers, the next step for virus writers is to impair the use of code emulators


## Anti-Emulation Techniques
- Many emulators only kept track of the integer CPU registers and memory, because viruses were not floating-point code
    - Viruses then began to deliberately use the floating point  coprocessor registers and instructions
    - More recently, MMX and SSE vector graphics instructions are appearing in viruses
    - Modern emulators have responded by emulating all registers and instructions


## Anti-Emulation Techniques
- The emulation environment is not always able to predict whether the next instruction will cause an exception
    - Viruses have been written to exploit this problem by putting part of their code in exception handlers, and then causing very subtle exceptions to occur
    - If part of the virus decompressor or decryptor code is in an exception handler, the emulator will fail to decrypt or decompress and emulation will try to execute garbage bytes


## Anti-Emulation: Time and Logic Bombs
- The virus can execute only at certain times of day (time bomb), or only under random conditions (logic bomb) that might be controlled by random number generation
- If the time or condition is not met, the virus just transfers control to the infected host program and does no damage
- When executed in an emulator, the virus will probably be dormant and cannot be analyzed by the emulator


## Anti-Emulation: Dynamic Code Length
- Code emulation is very slow (interpretation of an entire simulated machine environment)
- Not usually a problem, as most viruses start up pretty quickly and are written in tight code


## Anti-Emulation: Dynamic Code Length
- However, an anti-emulation virus could have huge loops of do-nothing instructions with a few real virus instructions thrown in, and a high loop count
    - Emulation becomes too lengthy
    - Can also be done by encoding brute-force decryptors into the virus, which run billions of instructions before successfully decrypting it


## Anti-emlation
- Szor, section 6.2.8.1, lists 18 different anti-emulation techniques used

# Anti-heuristic techniques
	  </textarea></section>
	  
	  <section data-markdown data-separator="^\n$"><textarea data-template>
## Anti-heuristic Viruses
- Scanning a PE file for virus code patterns is not always as simple as using regular expressions, especially when detecting new viruses or new variants
- Search heuristics have been developed that can find suspicious code without having exact patterns from a pattern database
    - Static heuristics are used in scanners to analyze executable files
    - Dynamic heuristics analyze code running under emulation


## Anti-heuristic Techniques
- It is common for virus code to be appended, or placed in the last section in the PE file
    - Scanners are programmed to flag PE files in which the entry point is directed to the last section of the file
    - This can cause a false positive for self-extracting archives, in which the extractor code is often at the end, so other heuristics must be used in combination with this one


## Anti-heuristic Techniques
- In addition to anti-emulation techniques directed against the dynamic heuristics, virus writers learned to write viruses in such a way as to evade the static scanners
- Virus writers responded by adding some of their own data sections after their code section, so the entry point was not the last section any more, e.g. the Resure virus


## Anti-heuristic Techniques
- Another way to append virus code without having the entry point be in the last section of the PE file is to place the beginning of the virus in the slack area at the end of the host program code section, with a jump to the appended virus code at the end
- Emulators have been designed to detect jumping from one PE file section to another


## Anti-heuristic Techniques
- The EPO (entry-point obscuring) techniques that we studied previously are also anti-heuristic techniques, as they make it hard for a scanner to detect that control passes to a virus
    - IAT replacement 
    - Call hijacking
    - Replacing a random call with a jump into the virus
- Modern scanners cannot just look at entry points and the top and bottom of PE files
    - Scanning is getting more expensive as a result

# Anti-goat techniques
	  </textarea></section>
	  
	  <section data-markdown data-separator="^\n$"><textarea data-template>
## Anti-goat Viruses
- Anti-virus software often uses *goat files*, a.k.a sacrificial goats, which are dummy files whose infection will signal the presence of a virus
    - Short, simple files, of known content
    - Easy to find a virus within them
    - Scattered around the disk in various file types that are prone to infection, e.g. *.exe, *.vbs, *.com
    - Also in various sizes, as viruses often infect only files with a certain minimum size
- Detecting which goat files are infected, and which are not, helps identify the virus


## Anti-goat Techniques
- An anti-goat virus will try to detect goat files and avoid infecting them
- Files are examined for goat file characteristics:
    - Lots of no-ops and do-nothing instructions
    - Clusters of files with sequential numbers in their names, 	e.g. abcd0001.vbs, abcd0002.vbs, etc.
- As with all armored virus techniques, the point is not to be the mythical "undetectable virus", but just to slow down detection and analysis

# Retroviruses
	  </textarea></section>
	  
	  <section data-markdown data-separator="^\n$"><textarea data-template>
## Retroviruses
- In nature, a retrovirus replicates in a different manner than normal viruses and is thus partly immune to many antiviral drugs
    - The HIV retrovirus attacks the immune system
- Computer retroviruses directly attack anti-virus software in an effort to make themselves immune
- Szor, section 6.3: "A retrovirus is a computer virus that specifically tries to bypass or hinder the operation of an antivirus, personal firewall, or other security programs."


## Vulnerability to Retroviruses
- Most of us log on to our personal computers with administrative capabilities
    - More convenient than having to change your login every time you perform an administrative task
    - Everyone was an administrator under DOS
- This gives a retrovirus the same administrative capabilities, meaning that it can kill anti-virus processes, remove anti-virus files, etc., just as you could
- Paves the way for other viruses to work freely
  - Might be the only function of a given retrovirus


## Retroviruses: Direct Attack on Security Software
- With admin capabilities, a retrovirus can kill the processes that it recognizes as being AV or firewall software, behavior blockers, etc.
    - A behavior blocker is a background process, from the OS or from an AV package, that prevents certain 	suspicious behaviors, such as changing the interrupt chain or doing a disk write to an existing executable file


## Retroviruses: Direct Attack on Security Software
- Sometimes, settings in firewalls and AV monitors can be changed to bypass them without killing them (stealthier than killing)
- Can also delete AV or firewall files from disk
- Many AV programs maintain an integrity checking database full of checksums and file sizes for various system files


## Retroviruses: Direct Attack on Security Software
- Retroviruses can attack this database:
    - Delete the files (not too stealthy)
    - Modify the files so that checksums and sizes must be recomputed for infected files; this hides the infection by storing the new sizes and checksums
    - Replace the database with a modified database that prevents virus detection, causes virus misidentification, and even launches viruses (i.e. database is now a Trojan horse)


## Example: Altering Integrity Database Entries
- The IDEA.6155 virus was designed to infect *.COM and *.EXE files while escaping detection in the integrity database:
    - The integrity database checksum record "thisfile.exe 23f7e65b" would be altered to "lhisfile.exe 23f7e65b" after infection of thisfile.exe
        - Notice the change to the first character from "t" to "l"


## Example: Altering Integrity Database Entries
- IDEA.6155 virus stealth, continued
    - AV integrity checker concludes, on its next scan, that thisfile.exe must be a new file, so it computes a checksum of the infected file and adds a new record to the integrity database: "thisfile.exe 269b7fc2"
    - Infected file now seems to have integrity


## Example: Altering Integrity Database Entries
- IDEA.6155 virus stealth, continued
    - Full scan will be required, searching for virus patterns, etc., to find the problem; full scans are not done often because of time constraints


## Retroviruses: Indirect Attacks on AV Programs
- Older versions of AV programs sometimes placed an integrity check record at the end of a validated file, with encrypted checksums
    - Files with a mark did not need to be scanned again
    - Cut down on scanning time by only scanning modified or newly created files
- The Tequila virus removed this record from files it infected, so that infection would not cause an integrity check failure


## Retroviruses: Indirect Attacks on AV Programs
- Simpler non-cryptographic checksums, such as CRC, can be defeated by appending a few bytes to an infected file that cause its new CRC checksum to match the old one
    - Hybris worm used this technique on PE files, which had to be restored (could not be repaired)
    - Search hyperlinked web page for "checksum".


## Retroviruses: Deterring AV Use
- A retrovirus can attack analysis tools used by anti-virus researchers
- A retrovirus can remain dormant until it detects AV software, then start damaging the system
- What would you do if the following message appeared on your screen:
> WARNING! Infected System! Virus will do no harm unless you install anti-virus software. Then it will destroy your files!
