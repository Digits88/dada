# Motivation
	</script></section>
      
	<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## First, a definition...
> malware: software that is intended to damage or disable computers and computer systems
	</script></section>
      
	<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Costs of Malware
- Cost of malware (worldwide):
  - 1997: $3.3 billion ([source](http://www.computereconomics.com/article.cfm?id=1225))
  - 2006: $13.3 billion ([source](http://www.computereconomics.com/article.cfm?id=1225))
  - 2014: $491 billion ([source](https://www.scmagazine.com/breaches-malware-to-cost-491-billion-in-2014-study-says/article/539302/))
- Companies often cover up the worst cases
- Does not include cost of security measures
	</script></section>
	
	<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Malware Costs: Example 1
- April 1999 time bomb: [Chernobyl](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIH_virus)
  - Overwrites first megabyte of the hard drive with zeros, then overwrites the BIOS
  - Only affects Windows 95, 98, and ME
- $250 million lost in one day in Korea alone; widespread across Asia
- Hard to quantify cost of lost files, time spent reinstalling OS and applications, etc.
	</script></section>
	
	<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Malware Costs: Example 2
- May 2000 mass mailer: [LoveLetter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loveletter)
  - Visual Basic script attached to email
  - Re-mailed itself to first 500 addresses in Outlook address book and also chat software
  - Also installed password-stealing software
  - Finally, copied itself over numerous existing files, destroying them
  - Caused $5.5 billion in damage
    - Ford Motor Company, among others, shut down all email for three days
	</script></section>
	
	<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Malware Costs: Example 3
- Winter / spring 2009: [Conficker virus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conficker)
  - The largest computer worm infection since 2003
  - More than ten million computers infected and under it's control
  - Used many of the techniques we will learn in this course
  - These controlled computer did not attempt to perform significant malicious action so the cost was minimal (other than removal)
    - But it could have been very high...
	</script></section>
	
	<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Malware Costs: Example 4
- 2010 / 2011: [Stuxnet worm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuxnet)
  - By far the most advanced piece of malware ever created at that point
  - It's goal (and it succeeded!) was to cripple Iran's nuclear enrichment
    - Said program was set back by 1-2 years
  - Authors have not come forward, but speculation is a joint Israel / US team
	</script></section>
	
	<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Malware Costs: Example 5
- [Ashley Madison data breach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashley_Madison_data_breach)
  - This is the site that peddled extra-marital affairs
  - They threated to release the site's DB info unless the site was closed down
    - No ransom was requested!
  - They did reveal the information, which led to embarassment and some suicides
  - Interestingly, almost all of the "female" members were bots...
	</script></section>
	
	<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Malware Costs: Example 6
- [2016 US election hacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_interference_in_the_2016_United_States_elections)
  - "The US intelligence community has concluded with high confidence that the Russian government interfered in the ... election"
  - Whether it affected the outcome is up for debate (and not one I want to engage in)
  - But the fact that they were able to interfere is worrisome
- Interfering in elections is a common tactic; the US has done so a lot as well ([source](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2016/10/13/the-long-history-of-the-u-s-interfering-with-elections-elsewhere/))
	</script></section>
	
	<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Malware Costs: Conclusion
- Computer viruses and other security attacks are very costly
- Computer security is a hot field today; many career and research opportunities for graduates from this course
- Knowledge of security issues is sensitive and carries an ethical responsibility with it
- ...but how can you write a detection software for a virus that does not exist yet?
	</script></section>
	
	<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Some more motivations
- US bills [SOPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_Online_Piracy_Act) / [PIPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PROTECT_IP_Act) from 2011 were intended to hinder piracy, it would allow serious security problems
  - There have been many such attempts since
- US drone fleet virus (see articles [here](http://www.tgdaily.com/security-features/58927-virus-infects-us-military-drones) and [here](https://www.wired.com/2011/10/virus-hits-drone-fleet/))
  - And people thought viruses were a thing of the past!

  - Or directly via https://libra.cs.virginia.edu/~pedagogy/index.php
  - It will allow for a much faster response time
- We'll also have Piazza as well
	</script></section>

## Student support
- [The events of 11 days ago](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unite_the_Right_rally) will have affected each of us in one way or the other
- In addition, this year will likely be stressful
- Remember that there are many student resources when you need support:
  - Lisa Lampe and Julie Carrucio in the Engineering office
  - CAPS
  - UVa student support (from CLAS): http://college.as.virginia.edu/student-services
  - And feel free to chat with us at any time

# Ethics
	</script></section>
	
	<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Computer Ethics
- We must teach how attacks upon computer systems work in order to teach defenses against attacks
- Information about attacks must NEVER be used to attack any computer system in any way
	</script></section>
	
	<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Ethics Pledge
- You will have to read and sign the ethics pledge
- It should not be difficult to follow
- Ethics will be covered in more detail later
- You cannot continue in the course without signing the [ethics pledge](../uva/ethics-pledge.pdf)!
- I'll collect them in the next class
	</script></section>
	
	<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Ethics Pledge Points
- Unauthorized use of computer resources is forbidden	
- Even a virus or worm that does nothing but copy itself uses resources
- Don't ever rationalize that a system owner won't object to your actions; ask permission
  - If you are afraid to ask permission, it must be forbidden!
	</script></section>
	
	<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Example: [1988 Morris Worm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morris_worm)
- Creator rationalized that the worm did no damage
  - It only copied itself from system to system over the Internet
- BUT: Copying monopolized system resources until they had to be shut down
- Worm reached 10% of entire internet
- Creator did not realize it would be that resource-intensive
- Creator was convicted of felonies!
  - And is now a professor at MIT.  Go figure!
	</script></section>
	
	<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Morris Worm Lessons
- Consequences of a virus or worm cannot always be foreseen
- Severe damage can be done without destroying data
- Excessive resource usage is destructive enough to be criminal
	</script></section>
	
	<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Criminal Prosecution
- Attackers have been prosecuted for:
  - Stealing passwords, even if never used 
  - Copying copyrighted materials
  - Accessing confidential data, even if it was never used for harmful purposes
  - Entering a system without permission, causing sys admins to spend time tracking them and securing the system, even without otherwise causing harm
- Moral: Don't assume it is legally safe to do any of the above
	</script></section>
	
	<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Ethics Violations
- Violations by students endanger our ability to offer this course
- As a result, they will be treated severely
  - UJC (University Judiciary Committee)
  - Course grades
  - Criminal prosecution
	</script></section>
	
	<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## ACM Code of Ethics
- ACM is the primary professional organization for computer scientists
- The entire code is available at http://www.acm.org/about/code-of-ethics 
	</script></section>
	
	<section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Ethics Questions
- Scenario: John Doe attempts to guess the password of a user of a system on which John Doe has no account. After a few guesses, he succeeds, but finds nothing of interest on the system and logs off.
- Q1: Has he committed a crime?
- Q2: Are his actions analogous to any common crime not involving computers?
