## Encrypted Viruses
- Virus encryption is both an anti-disassembly technique and an obstacle to virus detection using code patterns
- Encryption takes many forms
- The most advanced, difficult to defeat viruses use encryption techniques
- We will devote several lectures to understanding, detecting, and disinfecting various encrypted viruses


## Simple Encryption
- The earliest viruses to use encryption used a very simple decryption algorithm, such as XORing code with its own address
- The point was not to use advanced algorithms that were hard to analyze; just to slow down analysis and defeat pattern-based virus detection
- Because the decryptor code is always present in unencrypted form, there is not much point in choosing complex encryption/decryption methods
- The DOS virus Cascade was the first encrypted virus


## Example: Cascade Virus
- The simple decryptor of Cascade, circa 1990:
```
   lea  si,Start  ; start of encrypted code 
                  ; (computed by virus)
   mov  sp,0682h  ; length of encrypted code (1666 bytes)
Decrypt:
   xor  [si],si   ; xor code with its address
   xor  [si],sp   ; xor code with its inverse index
   inc  si        ; increment address pointer
   dec  sp        ; decrement byte counter
   jnz  Decrypt   ; loop if more bytes to decrypt
Start:         ; virus code body
```


## Cascade Virus Walkthrough
- Setting up the indices:
```
 lea  si,Start  ; start of encrypted code 
                ; (computed by virus)
```
- The virus does not have a "Start" label whose address is determined by a compiler
- Instead, it computes the address at infection time, depending on the location in the file being infected
- Virus uses hex offsets; we show "Start" to make it more readable


## Cascade Virus Walkthrough
- Stack pointer used as counter
```
mov  sp,0682h  ; length of encrypted code (1666 bytes)
```
- Virus knows its own length before it infects a new file
- Using the stack pointer is an anti-debugger technique
    - Cascade is therefore an armored virus
- However, this line of code is a distinctive pattern (signature) for this virus


## Cascade Virus Walkthrough
- The XOR encryption lines:
```
xor  [si],si   ; xor code with its address
xor  [si],sp   ; xor code with its inverse index
```
- The XOR operation is reversible:
	- f237h &oplus; 0682h = f4b5h
	- f4b5h &oplus; 0682h = f237h
- Very fast to encrypt and decrypt, yet sufficient to prevent detection by patterns
    - IMPORTANT: Even the hex patterns are file-dependent, because they depend on addresses


## Cascade Virus Walkthrough
- Increment counters/indices and loop:
```
inc  si        ; increment address pointer
dec  sp        ; decrement byte counter
jnz  Decrypt   ; loop if more bytes to decrypt
```
- With pattern-based detection impeded by encryption, an anti-virus researcher would like to step through the decryptor in a debugger and see the decrypted code
- However, use of stack pointer inhibits most debugger use


## Analyzing Cascade
- Prevention in the OS: don't allow writing to the executable code segment
	- Virus writer can work around this by decrypting into a buffer, rather than decrypting code in its place
- The best attack upon a simple encrypted virus is to detect the code patterns of the decryptor, e.g.
```
mov  sp,0682h  ; length of encrypted code (1666 bytes)
```


## Difficult Decryptors
- We can have multiple decryptors:
	- One decryptor loop might traverse the virus body, applying a decryptor function (e.g. XOR or something more complex)
	- Then another decryptor loop can traverse the virus code in reverse order applying a different decryption function
	- etc.


## Difficult Decryptors
- The unencrypted decryptor code could decrypt a piece of code that is a more complex decryptor...
    - ... which then decrypts another decryptor...
	- ... which decrypts the virus
- Static analysis of the patterns of the first decryptor would be irrelevant
	- That decryptor could be common to many viruses and also to commercial software


## Detecting Decryptors
- The main loop of the decryptor (a tight loop with XORs) looks like it would be a good subject for pattern-based detection
- But, many different viruses can use the same decryptor algorithm and have totally different payloads and behaviors
- A virus could pad itself out so that it has the same length as other, unrelated viruses


## Detecting Decryptors
- Even worse is the fact that some commercial software is obfuscated by an *anti-debug wrapper*, which looks just like the decryptor code for Cascade, in order to prevent reverse engineering of their product
	- Can produce false positives


## Detecting Decryptors cont.
- Memory allocation within the decryptor can produce a good code pattern to match
- Decryptor has three locations in which it can decrypt the virus code:
	1. In place; OS can disallow this
	2. In heap; allocation code is unencrypted and makes pattern-based detection easier
	3. On the stack; stealthiest choice


## Detecting Decryptors cont.
- How can an encrypted virus be detected if it uses stack allocation, makes itself look like a commercial anti-debug wrapper, makes itself the same length as unrelated viruses, etc.?
- Emulation and dynamic analysis are common approaches
	- Expensive
	- Proprietary


## Advanted compiler tools
- Phoenix, from Microsoft, could be used to dump the code after the decryption has occurred
	- Still need to black-box or sandbox the application to prevent damage
- SDT (software dynamic translation, or run-time compilation) decodes a program into a buffer as it runs
	- Can examine decrypted code in the translation cache/buffer
- clang and llvm have similar functionality


## Virus Code Evolution
- Simile is one example of a virus that evolves in order to frustrate pattern-based detection
- Each time it replicates, it generates a different memory allocation code sequence in the decryptor
	- Can be done with simple obfuscations, code re-orderings, etc.
- No single pattern matches the allocator
- More common is mutating the decryptor code itself and using stack allocation


## Decryptor Mutation
- Viruses that can evolve by mutating as they replicate can be classified in three categories, based on the degree of variety they produce:
	1. Oligomorphic viruses can produce a few dozen decryptors; they select one at random when replicating
	2. Polymorphic viruses dynamically generate code rearrangements and randomly insert junk instructions to produce millions of variants


## Decryptor Mutation cont'd
- Viruses that can evolve by mutating as they replicate can be classified in three categories, based on the degree of variety they produce:
	3. Metamorphic viruses apply polymorphic techniques to the entire virus body rather than just to a decryptor, so that one generation differs greatly from the previous generation; no encryption is even necessary to be classified as metamorphic

# Oligomorphic Viruses
	  </textarea></section>
	  
	  <section data-markdown data-separator="^\n$"><textarea data-template>
## Oligomorphic Viruses
- Detecting encrypted viruses that have distinctive decryptors was too easy (in the opinion of virus writers!)
- Whale was the first oligomorphic virus
- It carried several dozen decryptors in its body as data; when replicating, it selected one at random, encrypted the virus body with it, and deposited the body and the decryptor in the target file


## Oligomorphic Viruses cont.
- Carrying the decryptors as data is a burden to the virus, making it larger
- Memorial was a Windows 95 oligomorphic virus that generated 96 different decryptors, choosing one at replication time
	- Detecting 96 different patterns is an impractical solution for virus scanners that must deal with thousands of viruses; pattern database size explosion would result
- It inserted junk instructions at various points in the decryptor code


## Junk Instructions
- A junk instruction can be a no-op or do-nothing instruction, but it can also be an instruction that uses registers or memory locations that are unused in the decryptor
- Given the following decryptor loop for the Memorial oligomorphic virus:
```
Decrypt:
	xor [esi],al     ; decrypt a byte with key in AL
	inc esi          ; go to next byte
	inc al           ; slide the key up
	dec ecx          ; decrement the byte counter
	jnz Decrypt      ; loop back if more to decrypt
```


## Junk Instructions cont.
- Code patterns can be obfuscated with junk instructions:
<pre class="code">
Decrypt:
	<span class="junkcode">add ebx,edx        ; junk</span>
	xor [esi],al       ; decrypt a byte with key in AL
	<span class="junkcode">dec edx            ; junk</span>
	inc esi            ; go to next byte
	<span class="junkcode">mov [whocares],edx ; junk</span>
	inc al             ; slide the key up
	dec ecx            ; decrement the byte counter
	jnz Decrypt        ; loop back if more to decrypt
</pre>


## Junk Instructions cont.
- A different variant puts different junk instructions at different offsets:
<pre class="code">
Decrypt:
	<span class="junkcode">add bh,4           ; junk</span>
	<span class="junkcode">xor edx,edx        ; junk</span>
	xor [esi],al       ; decrypt a byte with key in AL
	inc esi            ; go to next byte
	<span class="junkcode">xchg ebx,edx       ; junk</span>
	inc al             ; slide the key up
	<span class="junkcode">cmp ebx,edx        ; junk</span>
	dec ecx            ; decrement the byte counter
	jnz Decrypt        ; loop back if more to decrypt
</pre>


## Junk Instructions cont.
- The index increment instructions are order-independent, creating more variants:

<pre class="code">
Decrypt:
	add bh,4           ; junk
	xor edx,edx        ; junk
	xor [esi],al       ; decrypt a byte with key in AL
	<span class="spotcode">inc al             ; slide the key up</span>
	xchg ebx,edx       ; junk
	<span class="spotcode">inc esi            ; go to next byte</span>
	cmp ebx,edx        ; junk
	dec ecx            ; decrement the byte counter
	jnz Decrypt        ; loop back if more to decrypt
</pre>


## Junk Instructions cont.
- There is more than one way to increment or decrement counters:
<pre class="code">
Decrypt:
	add bh,4           ; junk
	xor edx,edx        ; junk
	xor [esi],al       ; decrypt a byte with key in AL
	<span class="spotcode">add al,1           ; slide the key up</span>
	xchg ebx,edx       ; junk
	<span class="spotcode">add esi,1          ; go to next byte</span>
	cmp ebx,edx        ; junk
	<span class="spotcode">sub ecx,1          ; decrement the byte counter</span>
	jnz Decrypt        ; loop back if more to decrypt
</pre>


## Junk Instructions cont.
- There is more than one way to decrement a counter and loop back if it is not zero:
<pre class="code">
Decrypt:
	add bh,4           ; junk
	xor edx,edx        ; junk
	xor [esi],al       ; decrypt a byte with key in AL
	add al,1           ; slide the key up
	xchg ebx,edx       ; junk
	add esi,1          ; go to next byte
	cmp ebx,edx        ; junk
	<span class="spotcode">loop Decrypt       ; decrement the byte counter and
                       ;  loop back if more to decrypt</span>
</pre>


## Detecting Oligomorphic Viruses
- Clearly, it is easy to produce numerous variants of a decryptor
- Filtering out no-ops and do-nothings does not remove the obfuscation
- Emulation, debugging, or proprietary dynamic analyses are needed to produce the decrypted virus for analysis
- An advanced compiler tool could be a good alternatives

# Polymorphic Viruses
	  </textarea></section>
	  
	  <section data-markdown data-separator="^\n$"><textarea data-template>
## Polymorphic Viruses
- Whereas an oligomorphic virus might create dozens of decryptor variants during replication, a polymorphic virus creates millions of decryptors
- Pattern-based detection of oligomorphic viruses is difficult, but feasible
- Pattern-based detection of polymorphic viruses is infeasible
- Amazingly, the first polymorphic virus was created for DOS in 1990, and called [V2PX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1260_(computer_virus%29) or 1260 (because it was only 1260 bytes!)


## The 1260 Virus
- A researcher, Mark Washburn, wanted to demonstrate to the anti-virus community that string-based scanners were not sufficient to identify viruses
- Washburn wanted to keep the virus compact, so he:
	- Modified the existing Vienna virus
	- Limited junk instructions to 39 bytes
	- Made the decryptor code easy to reorder


## The 1260 Virus Decryptor
- One instance of a decryptor:
```
; Group 1: Prolog instructions
	mov ax,0E9Bh    ; set key 1
	mov di,012Ah    ; offset of virus Start
	mov cx,0571h    ; byte count, used as key 2
; Group 2: Decryption instructions
Decrypt:
	xor [di],cx     ; decrypt first 16-bit word with key 2
	xor [di],ax     ; decrypt first 16-bit word with key 1
; Group 3: Decryption instructions
	inc di          ; move on to next byte
	inc ax          ; slide key 1
; loop instruction (not part of Group 3)
	loop Decrypt    ; slide key 2 and loop back if not zero
; Random padding up to 39 bytes
Start:          ; encrypted virus body starts here
```


## The 1260 Virus: Polymorphism
- Sources of decryptor diversity:
  1. Reordering instructions within groups
  2. Choosing junk instruction locations
  3. Changing which junk instructions are used
- We will see that these variations are simple for the replication code to produce
- Can we really produce millions of variants in a short decryptor, just using these simple forms of diversity?


## Polymorphism: Reordering
- The 1260 decryptor has three instruction groups, with 3, 2, and 2 instructions, respectively
- The groups were the opcodes that could be permuted without changing the decryption result
	- i.e. there is no inter-instruction dependence among the instructions inside a group
- So, the reorderings within the groups produce 3! \* 2! \* 2! = 24 variants
- This gives a multiplicative factor of 24 to apply to all variants that can be produced using junk instructions


## Polymorphism: Junk Locations
- In a 2-instruction group, there are three locations for junk: before, after, and between
- However, there are far more possibilities than these three locations, as each location can hold from zero to 39 instructions
	- 39-byte junk inst. limit (imposed by Washburn)
	- Shortest x86 instructions take 1 byte; most are 2-3
	- Let's guess that the replicator will choose ~15 junk instructions totalling 39 bytes
	- 11 locations are possible throughout the decryptor


## Polymorphism: Junk Locations cont'd
- The choosing of 11 numbers from 0-15, that add up to exactly 15, can be done in how many ways?
	- 1+10+(10+C(10,2))+(10+P(10,2)+C(10,3))+(10+P(10,2)+C(10,2)+10+C(9,2)+C(10,4))+......  = 1+10+55+220+401+......
- This gives a multiplicative factor of several thousand to apply to all variants that can be produced using junk instruction selection and decryptor instruction reordering
	- So far, 24 * (several thousand) variants


## Polymorphism: Junk Instruction Selection
- How many instructions qualify as junk instruction candidates for this decryptor?
- x86 has more than 400 instructions
- Each has dozens of variants based on operand choice, register renaming, etc.:
	- add ax,bx; add bx,ax; add dx,cx; add ah,al; add si,1; add di,7  etc.
	- Immediate operands produce a combinatorial explosion of possibilities


## Polymorphism: Junk Instruction Selection
- Using only the registers that are unused by the decryptor will still produce hundreds of thousands of possibilities
  - So, 24 \* (several thousand) \* (hundreds of thousands) of variants = ~1 billion variants


## Polymorphism in V2PX/1260
- The 1260 virus made its replication code simpler by only allowing up to 5 junk instructions in any one location, and by generating only a few hundred of the possible x86 junk instructions
- That means it can produce (only) a million or so variants rather than a billion
- A short (1260 byte) virus is still able to use polymorphism to achieve a million variants of the short decryptor code
	- Pattern-based detection is hopeless


## Register Replacement
- The 1260 virus did not make use of another polymorphic technique: register replacement
- If the decryptor only uses three registers, the virus can choose different registers for different replications 
- Another multiplicative factor of several dozen variants can be added by this technique
	- A decryptor of only 8 instructions can produce over 100 billion variants by the fairly simple application of four polymorphic techniques!


## Mutation Engines
- Creating a polymorphic virus that makes no errors in replication and always produces functional offspring is difficult for the average virus writer
- Early in the history of virus polymorphism, a few virus writers started creating mutation engines, which can transform an encrypted virus into a polymorphic virus 
- The Dark Avenger mutation engine, also called MtE, was the first such engine (DOS viruses, summer 1991, from Bulgaria)


## MtE Mutation Engine
- MtE was a modular design that accepted various size and target file location parameters, a virus, a decryptor, a pointer to the virus code to encrypt, a pointer to a buffer to write its output into, and a bit mask telling it what registers to avoid using
- The engine then generated the polymorphic wrapper code to surround the virus code and replicate it polymorphically 


## MtE Mutation Engine
- MtE relied on generating variants of code obfuscation sequences in the decryptor, rather than inserting junk instructions
	- There are many convoluted ways to compute any given number


## MtE Decryptor Obfuscation
- Can you follow the computation of a value into register BP below?
```
mov bp,A16Ch
mov cl,03h
ror bp,cl
mov cx,bp         ; Save 1st mystery value in cx
mov bp,856Eh
or bp,740Fh
mov si,bp         ; Save 2nd mystery value in si
mov bp,3B92h      ; Put 3rd value into bp
add bp,si         ; bp := bp+ 2nd mystery value
xor bp,cx         ; xor result with 1st mystery value
sub bp,B10Ch      ; BP now has the desired value
```
- Many different obfuscated sequences can compute the same value into BP


## Detecting Polymorphic Viruses
- Anti-virus scanners in 1990-1991 were unable to cope, at first, with polymorphic viruses
- Soon, x86 virtual machines (emulators) were added to the scanners to emulate short stretches of code to determine if the result of the computations matched known decryptors
- This spurred the development of the anti-emulation techniques used in armored viruses


## Detecting Polymorphic Viruses
- The key to detection is that the virus code must be decrypted to plain text at some point
- However, this implies that dynamic analysis must be used, rather than static analysis, and anti-emulation techniques might inhibit the most widely used dynamic analysis technique
	- Some polymorphic viruses combine EPO techniques with anti-emulation techniques
- Again, an advanced compiler tool might be executed up to the point of decryption
    - Then the virus body can be examined in memory

# Metamorphic Viruses
	  </textarea></section>
	  
	  <section data-markdown data-separator="^\n$"><textarea data-template>
## Metamorphic Viruses
- Metamorphic Viruses
- A metamorphic virus has been defined as a *body-polymorphic* virus; that is, polymorphic techniques are used to mutate the virus body, not just a decryptor
- Metamorphism makes the virus body a moving target for analysis as it propagates around the world
- The techniques used to transform virus bodies range from simple to complex


## Source Code Metamorphism
- Unix/Linux systems almost always have a C compiler installed and accessible to all users
- A source code metamorphic virus such as Apparition injects source code junk instructions into a C-language virus and invokes the C compiler
- Amateur virus writers often created buggy viruses when they attempted to use polymorphism.  
- Source code metamorphism is easier to do correctly.


## Source Code Metamorphism cont'd
- By using junk variables at the source code level, the bugs that afflict many polymorphic and metamorphic viruses at the ASM level are avoided
	- e.g. accidentally using a register that is implicitly used by another instruction and was not really available for junk code)
- Because of differences in compiler versions, compiler libraries, etc., the resulting executable could vary across systems even if there were no source code metamorphism


## .NET/MSIL Metamorphism
- Windows systems do not always have a C compiler available
- Windows systems with some release of Microsoft .NET installed will compile MSIL (Microsoft Intermediate Language) into the native code for that machine
- A source code metamorphic virus can operate on MSIL code and invoke the .NET Framework to compile it
	- Probably a fertile field for viruses in the future
- The MSIL/Gastropod virus is one example


## Metamorphism with Phoenix
- Worst case: Phoenix is installed on the machine
- The virus could, conceivably, raise itself to a higher IR level
	- ... and then perform source code obfuscation
	- ... and then lower itself back to an executable format
- So Phoenix will save the world, and destroy it too...
- Luckily, few computers have Phoenix installed


## Early Metamorphic Viruses
- Very few on DOS, but the first was a DOS virus called ACG (Amazing Code Generator)
- The code generator generated a new version of the virus body each time it replicated (thus it was metamorphic)
- Although most metamorphic viruses use encryption, ACG did not
	- Being "body-polymorphic" is sufficient to avoid pattern-based detection


## Early Metamorphic Viruses cont'd
- ACG was not too damaging, because DOS was already a dying operating system when it was released in 1997
- This is a key difference between polymorphic and metamorphic viruses: the former mutates the decryptor, the latter might not even have a decryptor


## Early Metamorphics: Regswap
- Regswap was a Windows 95 metamorphic virus released in December, 1998
- The metamorphism was restricted to register replacement, as in these two generations:
```
pop edx                    pop eax
mov edi,0004h              mov ebx,0004h
mov esi,ebp                mov edx,ebp
mov eax,000Ch              mov edi,000Ch
add edx,0088h              add eax,0088h
mov ebx,[edx]              mov esi,[eax]
mov [esi+eax*4+1118],ebx   mov [edx+edi*4+1118],esi
etc.                       etc.
```


## Detecting Regswap
- Register replacement is not much of an obstacle to a hex-pattern scanner that allows the use of wild cards (don't-cares) in its patterns:
- The first two lines of the previous example, in hex, are:
<pre class="code">
5<span class="hotpink">A</span>                  5<span class="hotpink">8</span>
B<span class="hotpink">F</span>04000000          B<span class="hotpink">B</span>04000000
</pre>
	- Only the hex digits that encode registers differ
- If the scanner accepts wild cards, then both variants match 5?B?04000000


## Module Permutation
- Another metamorphosis of the virus body is to reorder the subroutines
	- Works best if code is in many small modules
	- First used in DOS viruses that did not even use encryption of the virus body, as a technique to defeat early scanners
- BadBoy had 8 modules: produces 8! = 40,320 permutations
	- However, short search strings (within modules) can still work if wild cards are used to mask the particular addresses and offsets in the code


## Metamorphic Build & Execute
- The Zmorph metamorphic virus appeared in early 2000 with a unique approach
- Many small virus code subroutines are added at the end of a PE file
	- They form a call chain among themselves
	- Each is body-polymorphic (metamorphic)
	- Each builds a little virus code on the stack
	- Execution is then transferred to the stack area when the building is complete
	- Payload is not visible inside the virus in normal patterns for a scanner


## Metamorphic Build & Execute
- Recall that the stack is the most stealthy place for a virus to use as scratch space
- How to detect this?
	- Emulators are used to detect Zmorph, as well as many other metamorphic viruses
	- Which means your virus scanner now has to do emulation, which causes it to take even longer


## Metamorphic Engines
- A metamorphic engine is a code replicator that has evolutionary heuristics built in:
	- Change arithmetic and load-store instructions to equivalent instructions
	- Insert junk instructions
	- Reorder instructions
	- Change built-in constants to computed values


## Metamorphic Engines
- Built-in constants are particularly important to pattern-based scanners
	- A metamorphic engine that can mutate constants from one generation to the next makes pattern-based static analysis difficult or impossible


## Metamorphic Engine Example
- The Evol virus of July, 2000
- Compare a code snippet from two generations, after several generations of evolution:
```
mov  dword ptr [esi],55000000h      ; 1st generation
mov  dword ptr [esi+0004],5151EC8Bh ; 1st generation
```
```
mov edi,55000000h      ;2nd gen., constant not changed
mov dword ptr [esi],edi
pop edi                ; junk
push edx               ; junk
mov dh,40h             ; junk
mov edx,5151EC8Bh      ; constant not changed yet
push ebx               ; junk
mov ebx,edx
mov dword ptr [esi+0004],ebx
```


## Evol Example cont.
- A later generation shows the constant mutation starting:
```
mov ebx,5500000Fh      ; 3rd gen., constant has changed
mov dword ptr [esi],ebx
pop ebx                ; junk
push ecx               ; junk
mov ecx,5FC0000CBh     ; constant has changed
add ecx,F191EBC0h      ; ECX now has original value
mov dword ptr [esi+0004],ecx
```
- As it replicates, the metamorphic engine makes just a few changes each generation, but the AV scanner code patterns change drastically 
- Eventually, all constants will be mutated many times


## Metamorphic Instruction Permutation
- The Zperm virus family used a method known from a DOS virus: reorder individual instructions and insert jumps to retain the code functionality; look at three generations of Zperm pseudocode:


## Zperm virus
```
jmp Start         jmp Start         jmp Start
Instr4            Instr2            Instr3
Instr5            jmp Instr3        Instr4
jmp End           junk              jmp Instr5
junk              Instr3            junk
Start:            jmp Instr4        Instr5
Instr1            junk              jmp End
Instr2            Instr5            Start:
jmp Instr3        jmp End           Instr1
junk              Start:            jmp Instr2
Instr3            Instr1            junk
jmp Instr4        jmp Instr2        Instr2
junk              Instr4            jmp Instr3
End:              jmp Instr5        junk
                  End:              End:
```


## Zmist
- "One of the most complex binary viruses ever written"
- EPO, metamorphic, a bit of everything
- First virus to include a code integrator (Mistfall)
	- Takes apart PE files, inserts it's code inside, reassembles it
	  - The reassembly properly fixes the jumps, reloation data, etc.
- Szor takes 4 full pages to describe all the things that this virus can do
	- http://vil.nai.com/vil/content/v_99382.htm 


## Simile
- Benign payload - displays a few messages here and there
- 14,000 lines of assembly code
	- 90% of which is the metamorphic engine
- [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simile_(computer_virus)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simile_(computer_virus%29)


## Instruction Permutation Detection
- Standard AV software uses an emulator to detect the effect of the code, rather than trying to statically analyze it
- An advanced compiler tool could make use of existing compiler transformations to simplify the jump chain into straight-line code


## Instruction Permutation Detection
- If the virus used no other metamorphic technique besides permutation, it could then be recognized by patterns
	- However, Zperm and related viruses also use instruction replacement, junk instruction insertion, etc. to be truly metamorphic even after jump chains are straightened

## Virus Creation Kits
- Allows novices to create viruses
- AV researchers have to study them well, to see all the viruses that they can produce
- Most produce source code, which can be tweaked further
	- And include the anti-disassembly, anti-debugging, anti-emulation, etc., techniques discussed previously
	  - Some can even do source-code metamorphism
- Hundreds of such kits available


## Virus Construction Set (VCS)
- The first one, back in 1990
- All viruses were 1,077 bytes, and named virus.com
- Viruses produced were quite simple
- Options: specify the message to be displayed, and select which generations would display the message
- Payload: delete startup config files, display message


## Kits of the 1990's
- GenVir (1990-1991)
	- Released as shareware, produced few viruses
- Virus Creation Laboratory (VCL) (1992)
	- Produced source code, not binary - required compilation
	- Had a large variety of payloads
	- Due to the number of options, viruses created were harder to detect
- PS-MPC (1992)
	- 15,000 variant viruses produced
	- The code engine produced code-morphed viruses

## NGVCK 
<!-- .slide: class="right-float-img-800" -->
Next Generation Virus Creation Kit (2001)
![NGVCK](images/09-adv-code-tech/ngvck.gif)

A VB script

Similar to VCL, but could infect PE files

Advanced assembly source morphing engine


## Anna Kournikova virus
- Most known virus created with a virus creation kit
	- Used the VBSWG kit
- People executed a AnnaKournikova.jpg.vbs e-mail attachment
- Which then e-mailed itself out to everybody in their Outlook address box
	- Author, 20-year old Jan de Wit created it, even though he did not know how to write a program


## Ethics question
- Is it ever ethical to create a virus using a virus creation tool?
	- If so, then when?


## Ethics question
- Is it ever ethical to create a virus using a virus creation tool?  If so, then when?
- The widely accepted guidelines is that it is ethical to use it only if doing for antivirus research purposes
	- The virus must be kept on a `dirty' PC
	- And completely destroyed once a detection means is achieved
		- Meaning not even a copy is stored for later testing
		- Of course, if you have the kit and take good notes, you can re-create it if needed...
