## Virus Code Patterns
- Viruses will often have very common assembly commands to do a tricky jump:
```
push virusfunc
ret
```
- Or to hook an interrupt:
```
mov eax, 4Ch 
mov [eax], edx
```
- In [HW 4](../hws/hw4-lex.html) you will write a flex scanner to detect these sequences


## Virus Obfuscation
- Assume that you have a virus scanner ([HW 5](../hws/hw5-obfuscation.html)) that looks for the two previous patterns
- Consider the following:
```
push virusfunc 
add eax, 0
ret 
```
- Or:
```
push virusfunc 
imul eax, 1
ret 
```
- How would the scanning routine find these?


## Defeating Obfuscation
- Can regular expression matchers defeat all attempts at obfuscating virus code?
- To answer this question, we need to examine all possible obfuscating instructions
- We have seen simple kinds of obfuscating instructions inserted into virus code: no-ops and do-nothings
  - e.g. add zero to a register, multiply a register by 1
- A finite list of such simple obfuscations can be filtered out by a tool such as lex


## Removing Obfuscations
- For the simple examples of obfuscations, we could just use lex or flex or a similar pattern matcher to filter out the obfuscating instructions
- The lex rules to perform the filtering would be simple, matching single instructions such as `nop` or `add eax, 0` or `imul ebx, 1`
- The virus scanner could then just match real virus code patterns


## Advanced Code Obfuscations
- Are all obfuscations simple enough to filter?
- A more advanced obfuscation is register renaming, e.g.:
```
add eax, 03FFh
mov edx, eax
```
- Or:
```
add ebx, 03FFh
mov esi, ebx
```
- The second uses ebx instead of eax, and esi instead of edx
  - This can't be done via flex alone!


## Defeating Register Renaming
- An advanced pattern matcher could use wildcard characters for all register fields within an instruction
- However, this removes most of the details of the code
- Some key details such as key constants used in the virus are still available
- The chances of a false positive (claiming that legitimate code is actually virus code) become unacceptably high with too many wildcards


## Inter-Instruction Dependencies
- A sequence of obfuscations instructions, interleaved with the virus code, that have no net effect:
```
; virus code can use edi here
add edi, 1  ; obfuscating instruction
; real virus code here that does not use edi
add edi, 3
; real virus code here that does not use edi
sub edi, 4
; real virus code can use edi starting here
```
- The number of possibilities is almost infinite
- A regex would have to "remember" arithmetic values; not possible with flex!


## Dependencies cont'd.
- Even worse: Obfuscating instructions could have a net effect that is NOT zero, but the register affected was unused by the virus code
  - e.g. remove the `sub edi, 4` instruction from previous example
- A compiler can analyze register usage and determine that a register is being overwritten with values that are not used later in the program. 
  - Can these analyses be done with just regular expressions and a pattern matcher?
- We need formal language theory to answer this

# Language Theory

	  <section data-markdown data-separator="^\n$"><textarea data-template>

## The problem specified
- Let's analyize a simple obfuscation: an arbitrary number of increments followed by an equal number of decrements
  - The net effect is zero!
- Start with a series of increments
  - `inc rax`; `add rax, 1`; `sub rax, -1`; etc.
- Followed by an equal number of decrements:
  - `dec rax`; `add rax, -1`; `sub rax, 1`; etc.
- We want to see if the *net effect* is zero


## Regular languages
- flex creates a *regular language*
  - level 3 on the Chomsky hierarchy
- A regular language does not have any memory or storage other than the state it is in
  - More powerful languages do have such a "memory"
- And, being a finite state machine, the states are finite!


## FSA and the Pumping Lemma
- Informal proof by contradiction: Suppose that an FSA with only $n$ states could recognize any number of increments followed by the same number of decrements
- Then, after more than *n* increments have been seen, the FSA will have to have visited at least one of its states more than once
- That state no longer remembers a single number of increments seen; e.g. it could represent having seen $k$ or $k+20$ increments


## Pumping Lemma cont'd
- This means that seeing the additional 20 increments caused the FSA to make a cycle back to that state
- Then, 20 more increments will cause it to come back to that state again
- The loss of memory means that the FSA will correctly match *n* increments with *n* decrements, but it will also incorrectly match *n+20* or *n+40* or *n+60*, etc., increments with *n* decrements


## Pumping Lemma cont'd
- We say that the first part of the input can be "pumped" up by an extra 20 increments without the FSA being able to track the pumping
- In your automata theory course, you have seen (or will see) a formal proof using the pumping lemma for regular languages


## Pumping Lemma cont'd
- The fundamental proof using this lemma is that an FSA cannot recognize the language $a^nb^n$, which has the same number of $a$ and $b$ terminals
- If "a" represents increments and "b" represents decrements, this is what we were (unsuccessfully) trying to recognize to defeat one kind of obfuscation


## Obfuscations and the Chomsky Hierarchy
- The language $a^nb^n$ is not a regular language
- In order to recognize it, we must move up the Chomsky hierarchy to context free languages
- $S \rightarrow aSb|e$  is a context free language that recognizes $a^nb^n$
- That which is impossible at one level of the Chomsky hierarchy is sometimes trivial at the next higher level


## Other Obfuscations
- Other obfuscations are even more complex to recognize
- Rather than simple increments and decrements, all sorts of complex arithmetic could be used to change and then restore the value of a register
- Even with simple increments and decrements, if any changed value of the register is used, then the increments and decrements were not junk instructions
- A tool such as flex cannot analyze such possibilities with regular expressions


## Defeating Complex Obfuscations
- A compiler combines recognition of regular expressions with recognition of context free languages and higher level semantic analyses
- By analyzing the flow of control and flow of data within the program, a compiler can answer questions that a regex pattern matcher can not
  - Is this value ever used, or is it junk?
  - If register assignments were changed in the code, what would the code look like?
  - Can complex arithmetic be simplified?

## Trivial Obfuscations
- Adding NOPs
  - `nop`, `add rax, 0`, `imul rax, 1`, `xchg rax, rax`, etc.
- Moidfying a register that is never used


## Simple algorithmic obfuscations
- Register replacement
- Multiple instructions that have no net effect
  - Instructions on an unused register that do have a net effect are on the previous slide


## Complicated algorithmic instructions
- Computing a constant through multiple instructions so that the constant value is not in the program code
