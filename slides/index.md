Defense Against the Dark Arts: Slides
=====================================

[Go up to the main readme file](../readme.html) ([md](../readme.md))

Note that a [bug](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=760436)
in current versions of Firefox will prevent the font used in the
slides from displaying correctly; Google Chrome does not have this
bug, and displays the slides correctly.

Please note that the slides are generally not finalized until the day
of lecture, and some of the links may not work until the lecture is
ready to be presented.
